## Introduction

We introduce CuratorNet, a neural network architecture for visually-aware recommendation of art images.

CuratorNet is designed with the goal of maximizing generalization: the network has a fixed set of parameters that only need to be trained once, and thereafter the model is able to generalize to new users or items never seen before, without further training. This is achieved by leveraging visual content: items are mapped to item vectors through visual embeddings, and users are mapped to user vectors by aggregating the visual content of items they have consumed.

In this repository, we provide a TensorFlow implementation of CuratorNet.

The full paper pre-print is available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04426), and is part of the ComplexRec workshop proceedings at the ACM RecSys 2020 conference.

- `Cell -> Run All`

## How does it work

CuratorNet leverages neural image embeddings obtained from pre-trained CNNs. We train CuratorNet to rank triplets that associate a user with a pair of images: one where we have positive feedback from said user, and one where we do not.

CuratorNet draws inspiration from [VBPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01784) and [Youtube’s Recommender System](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/es//pubs/archive/45530.pdf): we optimize for ranking using BPR loss, and seek generalization to new users without introducing additional parameters or further training. We also propose a set of sampling guidelines to generate triplets for training our model, which improves the performance of CuratorNet and VBPR with respect to random negative sampling.

To test our approach, we use an anonymised dataset of art purchases in an e-commerce website. Each transaction associates a user's ID with the ID and visual embedding of the painting that she bought. This dataset can be downloaded to train and evaluate CuratorNet, as seen in the table below. Although the artwork itself is not included, CuratorNet's architecture enables usage with any other dataset once trained.
